# Connect4
Player v Player connect 4 game

A collaborative effort by the members of <server name> on discord.  This will be a Player vs. Player game of connect 4, winner take all and will also receive an exclusive non-transferrable trophy!
  
Build notes and TO DOs:
  
  write the program
  
  Create SPL trophy tokens
  
  Are we going to make SPL game tokens, or do they buy spaces with SOL?
  
    will they be able to be customizable with the owners NFT art, or are we providing the art for the 2 players
  
  will it be possible to modify the Solana escrow program template for this?
